📝 Notes App
A lightweight, local-storage-powered, Markdown-enabled notes application built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This app allows you to create, edit, preview, search, and delete notes—all stored directly in the browser.

🚀 Features
Markdown Editor Write - notes in Markdown and toggle between Edit and Preview modes.
Local Storage Persistence - All notes are stored in localStorage, so they remain even after closing the browser.
Wiki-Style Links - Supports [[double bracket]] links to other notes (non-navigating placeholder UI included).
Search - Live search across titles and content.
Beautiful UI - Clean, modern, dark-themed layout inspired by contemporary note apps.
Note Management - Create, select, and delete notes with ease (with protection against deleting the last note).

📂 Project Structure 
This project is contained in a single HTML file: notes.html
It includes: 
Inline CSS for styling
JavaScript for application logic
HTML layout (sidebar + editor/preview workspace)

🛠️ How It Works
State Management
The app stores:
notes: Array of note objects (id, title, content, created)
activeNoteId: Which note is currently selected
editMode: Whether the editor or preview is active
searchQuery: Live filter value

Markdown Rendering
A minimal Markdown renderer is implemented with regex, supporting: #, ##, ### headings,**bold**, *italic*, ***bold+italic***, inline code, Line breaks, Wiki-style links [[like this]]

Storage:
Notes are saved in:
localStorage['notes-app-data']
localStorage['notes-app-active']
UI Components
Sidebar (search, create note, list of notes)
Editor and preview panel
Delete buttons on hover
Mode buttons (Edit / Preview)

▶️ Getting Started
1. Open the App
Simply open the file in a browser:
notes.html
no build step, no dependencies.
2. Start Taking Notes
Click + New Note
Write using Markdown
Switch to Preview to see rendered output

🧩 Customization
Feel free to modify:
Styles (contained inside <style>)
Markdown renderer (renderMarkdown function)
LocalStorage keys
Default example note
Sidebar width, font styles, note behavior, etc.

🐞 Troubleshooting
Notes not saving?
make sure your browser allows localStorage for local files. Chrome may require launching with special flags or using a simple local server like:
python3 -m http.server

LocalStorage full?
Browsers limit localStorage to ~5MB; large notes may eventually exceed this.
